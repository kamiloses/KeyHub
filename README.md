A web application built with ASP.NET Core, functioning as an online store for
computer games. Users can create accounts, log in, add funds to their account,
and purchase games with applied discounts and current stock levels. The system
allows searching and filtering games by price, genre, platform, and sorting by
various criteria. Purchase history is paginated and stored in In-Memory Cache.
Administrators have access to a management panel where they can add new
games along with images.

## 2. Account Management

You can either create an account or log in, depending on your situation. Validation has been implemented on both the client and server sides.  

By default, two users have already been created for you, so you can log in immediately without registering a new account:

- **Admin user**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Email: `admin@gmail.com`
  - Password: `Admin123!`
  - Role: Admin
  - Balance: 1000

- **Normal user**
  - Username: `user`
  - Email: `user@gmail.com`
  - Password: `User123!`
  - Role: User
  - Balance: 500

This allows you to test both admin and regular user functionalities right away.
